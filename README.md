# javascript-mini-exercise
mini javascript code, to guess a number from 0-100
each time a random number from 0 to 100 is generated and stored, your job is to guess this number.
after each guess, your chances get incremented. and if your guess is wrong and is lesser than the correct number, "guess wrong, number is lower" is displayed
similarly if the number entered is greater than the correct guess, "number is greater" is printed.
after the correct answer is guessed, the diffrence of number of chances from 100 is retuned as the marks.
